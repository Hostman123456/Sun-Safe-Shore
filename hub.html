            <p>Hi, I'm Max. For my ASC Demo Day project, I created Sun Safe Shore(SSS), a web applicaion dedicated to being a place where people can be safely educated on the dangers of skin cancer. The project itself is inspired by Project Sun Safe, a program that raises awareness for skin cancer in Long Island.</p>

                <h3>Melanoma</h3>
                Definition- is a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes start to grow out of control. (Melanocytes gives the skin its tan or brown color/melanin)
                <br>
                -These cells are in the deep layer of the epidermis between the layers of basal cells. This skin cancer is dangerous because of its ability to spread to other organs rapidly if it is not treated at an early stage. 
                -Only 20-30% of melanomas are found in existing moles. While 70-80% arise on normal-looking skin. This makes it harder to identify melanoma. 
                Occurs: When skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, it causes skin damage that triggers the melanocytes to produce more melanin, but only the melanin pigment attempts to protect the skin by causing the skin to darken or tan. Melanoma occurs when DNA damage due to UV radiation triggers mutations in the melanocytes, resulting in uncontrolled cellular growth.
