            <p>Hi, I'm Max. For my ASC Demo Day project, I created Sun Safe Shore(SSS), a web applicaion dedicated to being a place where people can be safely educated on the dangers of skin cancer. So many times, young people especially ignore the problems their actions will cause in the future, only for them to grow up and curse their younger selves. This website is meant to stop the same story happening over and over when it comes to Skin Cancer. The project itself is inspired by Project Sun Safe, a program that raises awareness for skin cancer on Long Island.</p>

                -a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes(cells that give skin melanin) start to grow out of control.
                <br>
                -These cells are in the deep layer of the epidermis. This skin cancer is dangerous because of its ability to spread to other organs rapidly if left unchecked.

                -Presents itself as a spot of brown, black, or red color. Remember the ABCDEs of identifying melanoma
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Asymmetry-the spot is different on each </li>
                    <li>Border-unusual border, for example a scalloped border</li>
                    <li>Color-irregular color ex. Blue and red in one spot, dark tan in another</li>
                    <li>Diameter-the diameter is larger than that of your standard pencil eraser</li>
                    <li>Evolving-rapidly evolves, changing color, shape, and growing and shrinking over time</li>
                </ol>
               
                -Only 20-30% of melanomas are found in existing moles. While 70-80% arise on normal-looking skin. This makes it harder to identify melanoma. 
                Occurs: When skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, it causes skin damage that triggers the melanocytes to produce more melanin, but only the melanin pigment attempts to protect the skin by causing the skin to darken or tan. Melanoma occurs when DNA damage due to UV radiation triggers mutations in the melanocytes, resulting in uncontrolled cellular growth.

<br>
<br>
-Very common (Around 3 million cases/year)
<br>
-Basal cell produce new cell and old one dies.
<br>
-BCC grows slowly and most are curable if detected early.
<br>
-BCC occur due to DNA damages, causing basal cells to change/mutate leading to unremitting growth.
<br>
-90% are caused by UV radiation
<br>
-Diagnosis and treatment for BCC improved by 77% from 1994-2014
<br>
-Mohs surgery used often to remove any BCC spots and the layer is later examined to see if any cancerous cells remains</p>

-Tends to grow and spread fast across the body<br>
-Rates are steadily increasing, with a 95% increase from 2000 to 2013<br>
-Largely affects people older than 65 years old, with most patients seldom using sunscreen when outside<br>

-The virus, Merkel Cell polyomavirus, lives on the skin and doesnâ€™t show symptoms and this is the cause of Merkel cell <br>

Excessive Exposure to either artificial or natural sunlight,
A weakened immune system: Those that have HIV or take drugs that suppress the immune system response,
History of other skin cancers,
Older Age

    <p>
        derives from squamous cells, which are found inside the epedermis(top layer of skin) continously shedding and recreating themselves. Once enough mutations accumulate, either through UV radiation or other means, Squamous Cell Carcinoma can begin to occur. 
        <br>
        Relatively common, with 205 cases are diagnosed every hour. It is not usually fatal, but if left unchecked it can move to other parts of the body and weak havoc

        <img src = "images/squamous.jpg" />
        <br>
        <br>
        can appear as scaly red patches on the skin, wart-like lesions, or raised growths with a divot in the center, most often growing over weeks or months. It normally is about an inch long in diameter. Commonly, it appears in areas wih a lot of exposure to such as the head, but can appear in areas that are also rarely exposed to sunlight, even appearing in your mouth.
        If caught early, it can be treated quite easily in the early stages, but can become more difficult the further it progresses. 
        <br>
        The main stages are 
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Stage 1: Only in your epidermis</li>
            <li>Stage 2: In both your epidermis and your dermis(middle layer of your skin)</li>
            <li>Stage 3: It has began to effect your subcutis(last layer of skin, with nerves)</li>
            <li>Stage 4: It has begun to effect other organs like your brain and your liver</li>
