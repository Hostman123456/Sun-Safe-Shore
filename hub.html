            <p>Hi, I'm Max. For my ASC Demo Day project, I created Sun Safe Shore(SSS), a web applicaion dedicated to being a place where people can be safely educated on the dangers of skin cancer. The project itself is inspired by Project Sun Safe, a program that raises awareness for skin cancer in Long Island.</p>

                -a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes(cells that give skin melanin) start to grow out of control.
                <br>
                -These cells are in the deep layer of the epidermis. This skin cancer is dangerous because of its ability to spread to other organs rapidly if left unchecked. 
                <br>
                -Presents itself as a spot of brown, black, or red color. Remember the ABCDEs of melanoma

                <ol>
                    <li>Assymetry-the spot is different on each </li>
                
                -Only 20-30% of melanomas are found in existing moles. While 70-80% arise on normal-looking skin. This makes it harder to identify melanoma. 
                Occurs: When skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, it causes skin damage that triggers the melanocytes to produce more melanin, but only the melanin pigment attempts to protect the skin by causing the skin to darken or tan. Melanoma occurs when DNA damage due to UV radiation triggers mutations in the melanocytes, resulting in uncontrolled cellular growth.

<p>Very common (Around 3 million cases/year)
Rolled border/central ulcer/transparent/discoloration 
Basal cell produce new cell and old one dies.
BCC grows slowly and most are curable if detected early.
BCC occur due to DNA damages, causing basal cells to change/mutate leading to unremitting growth.
90% are caused by UV radiation
Diagnosis and treatment for BCC +77% from 1994-2014
Mohs surgery used often to remove any BCC spots and the layer is later examined to see if any cancerous cells remains</p>

<p>Rare, aggressive Skin Cancer (roughly 2000 per year)
Appears as a flesh-colored or bluish-red nodule often on your face, neck or head, but can pop up anywhere
Tends to grow and spread fast across the body
Merkel cells are found in the the epidermis, the most outermost layer of your skin
Largely affects age groups older than 65 years old
Rates are steadily increasing (2000-2013, the rate spiked 95%)
Majority of those affected seldom to protect their skin by using sunscreen
The common treatment that patients adhere to is getting treatment to their needs or gaining the latest treatments to MCC
The virus, Merkel Cell polyomavirus, lives on the skin and doesnâ€™t show symptoms and this is the cause of Merkel cell Carcinoma
Risk factors:
Excessive Exposure to either artificial or natural sunlight
A weakened immune system: Those that have HIV or take drugs that suppress the immune system response 
History of other skin cancers
Older Age
Demographic: Those with lighter skins are more prone to this skin cancer</p>
